Remember that Linux is only a kernel, the central driving force of an operating system that allocates resources to other aspects of the system. Linux, along with the GNU system (which is closely associated with the Free Software Foundation (FSF)) are collectively referred to as GNU/Linux or sometimes GNU Linux, make up a complete operating system which is widely used today by millions of freetards across the world.
Why is the Disk Called Disk if it isn't a Disk? PCs were popularized at a time when all mass storage media were disks: we had floppy disks, hard disks, and compact disks (CDs), which were all circular and flat like you would expect from a disk.
A mobile disk is a term for a portable disk, which, nowadays, refers to a hard disk drive or SSD that is connected via USB, externally, without needing to be installed inside the computer where it would be connected via SATA or PCIe. It's also a term for USB flash drive products sold by TwinMOS.
No matter where you go, everyone's connected.
Why SSDs are Faster Than HDDs? Hard disk drives are slower because the data is stored in a disk that needs to be spun in order to be read, while the data in solid state drives are as fast as electricity.
The hard disk (HDDs) spins at a very fast speed, and the needle has microscopic precision. It's all very amazing, but the disk still needs to be spun, which adds some latency.
SSDs store data by trapping electrons inside of them in something called non-volatile flash memory. This flash memory technology is used in thumb drives as well, so an SSD is just a big thumb drive that is installed inside the PC instead of plugged into a USB port.
What is Pixel Density? It refers to the amount of pixels per inch (PPI) that a screen can display. It's also used in the sense of digital images, when a single image has multiple versions (multiple files) at different resolutions designed to be displayed at different pixel densities.
A motherboard (sometimes called a MoBo) is the most important internal physical component (hardware) of a typical computer. The motherboard is the medium through which all electronic components of your computer communicate with each other. Because the CPU is physically installed in one place and the RAM is physically installed in another place, in order for the CPU to talk to the RAM, and vice-versa, there must be a path between the two of them. This path is carved into the motherboard.
The motherboard is a bunch of paths where data goes through. It's a bunch of electronic circuits where electronic signals go through. If data was cars, the motherboard would be a city full of streets
Difference between CPU and GPU: They both are important components of computing systems but they are assigned different tasks. CPU has a few powerful cores that are designed for general-purpose, Sequential Processing. GPU has many small cores that are designed especially for tasks like graphics rendering and parallel computation.
A Central processing unit (CPU) is commonly known as the brain of the computer. It is a conventional or general processor used for a wide range of operations encompassing the system instructions to the programs.
Intel CPUs are most efficient when it comes to single-threaded operations, which include typing or web surfing.
CPUs are capable of performing various tasks, they may include operating systems and application software.
CPUs can manage to run several programs at once because of the thread allocation to several tasks.
The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is designed for parallel processing and it uses dedicated memory known as VRAM (Video RAM). They are designed to tackle thousands of operations at once for tasks like rendering images, 3D rendering, processing video, and running machine learning models. It has it’s own memory separate from the system’s RAM which allows them to handle complex, high-throughput tasks like rendering and AI processing efficiently.
API full form is an Application Programming Interface that is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them.
