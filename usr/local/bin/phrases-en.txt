Remember that Linux is only a kernel, the central driving force of an operating system that allocates resources to other aspects of the system. Linux, along with the GNU system (which is closely associated with the Free Software Foundation (FSF)) are collectively referred to as GNU/Linux or sometimes GNU Linux, make up a complete operating system which is widely used today by millions of freetards across the world.
Why is the Disk Called Disk if it isn't a Disk? PCs were popularized at a time when all mass storage media were disks: we had floppy disks, hard disks, and compact disks (CDs), which were all circular and flat like you would expect from a disk.
A mobile disk is a term for a portable disk, which, nowadays, refers to a hard disk drive or SSD that is connected via USB, externally, without needing to be installed inside the computer where it would be connected via SATA or PCIe. It's also a term for USB flash drive products sold by TwinMOS.
