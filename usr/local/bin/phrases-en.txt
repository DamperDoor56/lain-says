Remember that Linux is only a kernel, the central driving force of an operating system that allocates resources to other aspects of the system. Linux, along with the GNU system (which is closely associated with the Free Software Foundation (FSF)) are collectively referred to as GNU/Linux or sometimes GNU Linux, make up a complete operating system which is widely used today by millions of freetards across the world.
Why is the Disk Called Disk if it isn't a Disk? PCs were popularized at a time when all mass storage media were disks: we had floppy disks, hard disks, and compact disks (CDs), which were all circular and flat like you would expect from a disk.
A mobile disk is a term for a portable disk, which, nowadays, refers to a hard disk drive or SSD that is connected via USB, externally, without needing to be installed inside the computer where it would be connected via SATA or PCIe. It's also a term for USB flash drive products sold by TwinMOS.
No matter where you go, everyone's connected.
Why SSDs are Faster Than HDDs? Hard disk drives are slower because the data is stored in a disk that needs to be spun in order to be read, while the data in solid state drives are as fast as electricity.
The hard disk (HDDs) spins at a very fast speed, and the needle has microscopic precision. It's all very amazing, but the disk still needs to be spun, which adds some latency.
SSDs store data by trapping electrons inside of them in something called non-volatile flash memory. This flash memory technology is used in thumb drives as well, so an SSD is just a big thumb drive that is installed inside the PC instead of plugged into a USB port.
What is Pixel Density? It refers to the amount of pixels per inch (PPI) that a screen can display. It's also used in the sense of digital images, when a single image has multiple versions (multiple files) at different resolutions designed to be displayed at different pixel densities.
A motherboard (sometimes called a MoBo) is the most important internal physical component (hardware) of a typical computer. The motherboard is the medium through which all electronic components of your computer communicate with each other. Because the CPU is physically installed in one place and the RAM is physically installed in another place, in order for the CPU to talk to the RAM, and vice-versa, there must be a path between the two of them. This path is carved into the motherboard.
The motherboard is a bunch of paths where data goes through. It's a bunch of electronic circuits where electronic signals go through. If data was cars, the motherboard would be a city full of streets
Difference between CPU and GPU: They both are important components of computing systems but they are assigned different tasks. CPU has a few powerful cores that are designed for general-purpose, Sequential Processing. GPU has many small cores that are designed especially for tasks like graphics rendering and parallel computation.
A Central processing unit (CPU) is commonly known as the brain of the computer. It is a conventional or general processor used for a wide range of operations encompassing the system instructions to the programs.
Intel CPUs are most efficient when it comes to single-threaded operations, which include typing or web surfing.
CPUs are capable of performing various tasks, they may include operating systems and application software.
CPUs can manage to run several programs at once because of the thread allocation to several tasks.
The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is designed for parallel processing and it uses dedicated memory known as VRAM (Video RAM). They are designed to tackle thousands of operations at once for tasks like rendering images, 3D rendering, processing video, and running machine learning models. It has it’s own memory separate from the system’s RAM which allows them to handle complex, high-throughput tasks like rendering and AI processing efficiently.
API full form is an Application Programming Interface that is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them.
The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved
SATA (as in SATA cables, SATA ports, and SATA connectors) is a type of connector used in your PC to connect your motherboard to your hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs). That is, in order to install a new HDD or SDD in your computer, you need to connect it to the motherboard using a SATA data cable to one of the available SATA ports on the motherboard, and use a SATA power cable to connect the drive to the PSU (power supply unit).
You might have heard of chmod 777. This command will give read, write and execute permission to the owner, group and public.
pwd command in Linux is commonly used to identify the files and directories in the working directory.
The pwd command is mostly used to print the current working directory on your terminal.
This mkdir command allows you to create fresh directories in the terminal itself. The default syntax is mkdir <directory name> and the new directory will be created.
The cd command is used to navigate between directories. It requires either the full path or the directory name, depending on your current working directory. If you run this command without any options, it will take you to your home folder. Keep in mind that it can only be executed by users with sudo privileges.
The rmdir command is used to delete permanently an empty directory. To perform this command the user running this command must be having sudo privileges in the parent directory. 
The cp command of Linux is equivalent to copy-paste and cut-paste in Windows. 
The mv command is generally used for renaming the files in Linux.
rm command in Linux is generally used to delete the files created in the directory. 
The uname command is used to check the complete OS information of the system.
The touch command creates an empty file when put in the terminal in this format as touch <file name> 
The ln command is used to create a shortcut link to another file.
The cat command is the simplest command to use when you want to see the contents of a particular file. The only issue is that it simply unloads the entire file to your terminal
The clear command is a standard command to clear the terminal screen.
ps command in Linux is used to check the active processes in the terminal.
The man command displays a user manual for any commands or utilities available in the Terminal, including their name, description, and options. man <command name>
The grep command is used to find a specific string in a series of outputs. For example, if you want to find a string in a file, you can use the syntax: <Any command with output> | grep "<string to find>". eg: cat README.md | grep "package"
echo command in Linux is specially used to print something in the terminal
The wget command in the Linux command line allows you to download files from the internet. It runs in the background and does not interfere with other processes. Here is the basic syntax: wget [option] [url] wget http://sample.com/sample-menu.php
The whoami command provides basic information that is extremely useful when working on multiple systems. In general, if you are working with a single computer, you will not require it as frequently as a network administrator.
The sort command is used generally to sort the output of the file.
The cal command is not the most famous command in the terminal but it functions to view the calendar for a particular month in the terminal.
whereis command in Linux is generally used to see the exact location of any command typed after this.
df command in Linux gets the details of the file system.
wc command in Linux indicates the number of words, characters, lines, etc using a set of options. wc -w shows the number of words, wc -l shows the number of lines, wc -m shows the number of characters present in a file
The first ever Linux kernel just occupied only 65 KB.
We say a program has failed silently, crashed silently, or silently done something if it has done it without displaying a message to the user, such as an error dialog, a success message dialog, or printed something on the terminal. Doing things silently is a usability bug. Silent failures prevent users from troubleshooting the software they use, and succeeding silently makes them uncertain if they actually clicked the button or not inducing them to press the same button two times since they got not response the first time, which could be a potentially destructive operation.
A memory leak is an error in the programming of a program that causes it to eventually consume infinite memory. Since you don't have infinite RAM in your PC, that means the program will eventually run out of memory because it keeps needing more and more RAM until the operating system doesn't have any RAM left to give to it.This means the program will reserve a space for the data, use it to store its data, and when the program finishes, it's supposed to "free" the memory, i.e. it's supposed to tell the operating system that it no longer needs that space in memory because it already finished doing what it was doing with it. A memory leak happens when the program doesn't contain or never executes the command to free the reserved space.
Different programming languages handle reserving memory differently, but all programs effectively need to reserve RAM memory. It's possible to write a program that does computations without RAM, using only the few bytes of memory available inside the CPU (the CPU registers), but this is a very, very small amount of data. Realistically, any program or subprogram, no matter how small, will store the data of its variables in RAM.This means the program will reserve a space for the data, use it to store its data, and when the program finishes, it's supposed to "free" the memory, i.e. it's supposed to tell the operating system that it no longer needs that space in memory because it already finished doing what it was doing with it.
The reason why memory leaks happen is typically because low level languages like C and C++ require the programmer to allocate and free the memory manually. High level programming languages like Python, Java, C#, and Javascript have something called a garbage collector (GC) which automatically figures out what data was reserved by the program that no subprogram has the address of anymore. 
It's possible to create memory leaks even in garbage-collected languages like Javascript. All you need to do is create a situation where an object was created that should have been deleted, but you forgot to delete it, so it keeps occupying space in reserved memory permanently. The more objects you create and forget about, the more memory it wastes.
To delete means "to erase" data, except not exactly. We can delete files in our computer, delete folders that contain files, delete layers in an image editor, delete things in all sorts of applications, however, none of this reduces the amount of memory in the computer, it just changes the data that exists in memory.
Open source software are programs that have the source code used to created them made publicly available for everyone to read. Normally, we call "open source" only programs that can also be modified, forked, and redistributed, i.e. libreware, which means the developers who wrote the source code and thus own the copyright of the code must have published it under a permissive license such as GPL, LGPL, MIT, etc. If a program's source code is made available but you can't create and publish your own version of the program from that source code, then the term used is "source available" instead.
On Linux, a daemon is a term for a program that runs in the background, and stays running all the time, providing utilities for other programs or waiting for a request from the Internet or a local network. They're comparable to "services" in Windows. By convention, names of daemon programs tend to end in d, like systemd, httpd, mysqld, dockerd, etc.
